Build a Predictive Model so as to suggest the most suitable Crops to grow based on the available Climate and soil Conditions. 
There are 7 key factors that I've taken into account which will help us in determining, exactly which crop should be grown
 and at what period of time, viz. Amount of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium in soil, Temperature in degree celcius, Humidity, pH and Rainfall in mm.

Tools used: Python & Jupyter Notebook Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib,flask, ipywidgets and sklearn.
 Machine Learning Algorithms used: Clustering Analysis and Logistic Regression.

Deploy the model by using flask and link with html.
